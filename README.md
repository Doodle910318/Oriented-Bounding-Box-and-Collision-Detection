# Oriented-Bounding-Box-and-Collision-Detection
This project validates and simulates the approach using C and Verilog. The current focus is on the correctness of the algorithm and its functions, with the bounding volume and collision-detection space set to 256 Ã— 256 cm (including signed arithmetic). Future work will refine the design for specific object types.
